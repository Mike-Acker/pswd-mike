# pswd-mike
password generator for linux

use: command line: pswd <len> <nr> [<special characters>]

The idea here is to have a Quick and Handy password generator.   Alas, I'm an old System/370 ASM programmer 
who can c a little bit;    enough to get this together.

My main intention here though, -- is to learn a little bit about github.
